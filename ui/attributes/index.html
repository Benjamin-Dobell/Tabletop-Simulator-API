<div class="admonition important">

<p>For XML, most of the attribute types are self-explanatory, like string or float (See Lua Scripting section for details on those). However XML has some unique types.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">On Sizing Elements</p>
<p>Minimum and preferred sizes are defined in regular units, while the flexible sizes are defined in relative units. If any layout element has flexible size greater than zero, it means that all the available space will be filled out. The relative flexible size values of the siblings determines how big a proportion of the available space each sibling fills out. Most commonly, flexible width and height is set to just 0 or 1.</p>
